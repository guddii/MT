= Preamble

== Introduction

The <<Solid>> Project is an RDF-based ecosystem that aims to achieve a decentralized web for persons, social entities, or software.
The technology is new and not yet fully mature.
The current version is missing some essential features required for production environments.
Ongoing research and development is being conducted to improve the ecosystem, resulting in the regular introduction of new features or Solid providers.

This thesis aims to develop and analyze a <<Solid>>-based application that aligns with the <<Solid>> ecosystem without enforcing it.
The application will enhance data privacy concerns, specifically in terms of data traceability and access control.
The goal is to increase visibility and track requested resources from parties within and beyond the ecosystem through logs and their representation.
These requests should be processed and made manipulatable to achieve better control over the exposed data.
All of these achievements should be established in a clear context and communicated through data <<API>>s to ensure safety for new features and potential changes in <<Solid>> providers.

== Terminology

=== Solid Protocol

Describe the definition of a protocol

- see Mozilla Developer Networkfootnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol]
- see citenp:[fischer_lexikon_2011(706)]

Describe the Solid protocol

- see citenp:[sarven_solid_2022]

Describe <<CSS>>

- see Community Solid Server configuration generatorfootnote:[https://communitysolidserver.github.io/configuration-generator/v7/]
* Data management
** Data storage (<<CRUD>>/<<SPARQL>>)
** Authorization (<<WAC>>/<<ACP>>)
** Locking
* Account management
** Pod URLs (Suffix/Subdomain)
** OpenID provider
* Miscellaneous
** Notification method (WebSockets/Webhooks)
** <<HTTP>>/<<HTTPS>>

=== Proxy

Describe the general idea of a proxy

- see citenp:[luotonen_world-wide_1994]
* Server-Client model
* Position of the proxy (client-side vs. server-side)

Describe a application layer proxy

- see citenp:[?]
* OSI model
* Position of the proxy
* Difference to other proxies

=== Data Privacy Cockpit

Describe the idea of a <<DPC>>

== Conclusion

Viewing and using requests to the web server was a task that was almost exclusively reserved for the operators or administrators of a service.
For the first time functions can be viewed and controlled by users, as they own the content or have sufficient rights.
