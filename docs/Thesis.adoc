== Introduction

=== Requirements

==== Functional Requirements

[horizontal,labelwidth=10,itemwidth=80]
[[REQ-1,REQ-1]] REQ-1:: Access logs with different views depending on the mandate.
[[REQ-2,REQ-2]] REQ-2:: Transmission logs with the specific content of the transmitted resource.
[[REQ-3,REQ-3]] REQ-3:: Rule-based filtering of network requests by the owner of the resource.

==== Non-Functional Requirements

[horizontal,labelwidth=10,itemwidth=80]
[[REQ-4,REQ-4]] REQ-4:: Ensuring compatibility with the current version of the Solid protocol.
[[REQ-5,REQ-5]] REQ-5:: Conformity with the general properties of a proxy must be guaranteed.
[[REQ-6,REQ-6]] REQ-6:: Efficiency in terms of response times and resource consumption must be appropriate.
[[REQ-7,REQ-7]] REQ-6:: Metadata that could be extracted from the request should be analysed and logs should be enhanced accordingly.

== Terminology

=== Solid Protocol

Describe the definition of a protocol

- see Mozilla Developer Networkfootnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol]
- see citenp:[fischer_lexikon_2011(706)]

Describe the Solid protocol

- see citenp:[sarven_solid_2022]

Describe <<CSS>>

- see Community Solid Server configuration generatorfootnote:[https://communitysolidserver.github.io/configuration-generator/v7/]
* Data management
** Data storage (<<CRUD>>/<<SPARQL>>)
** Authorization (<<WAC>>/<<ACP>>)
** Locking
* Account management
** Pod URLs (Suffix/Subdomain)
** OpenID provider
* Miscellaneous
** Notification method (WebSockets/Webhooks)
** <<HTTP>>/<<HTTPS>>

=== Proxy

Describe the general idea of a proxy

- see citenp:[luotonen_world-wide_1994]
* Server-Client model
* Position of the proxy (client-side vs. server-side)

Describe a application layer proxy

- see citenp:[?]
* OSI model
* Position of the proxy
* Difference to other proxies

=== Data Privacy Cockpit

Describe the idea of a <<DPC>>

- see citenp:[diederich_xdatenschutzcockpit_2023]
