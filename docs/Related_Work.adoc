Since 2018, the Solid Community Groupfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/community/solid/] has been responsible for the management of the Solid Project.
Due to the relatively small size of the group and its limited public visibility, the level of activity within the community is correspondingly low.
Consequently, research sources are limited and related work is almost non-existent.
However, some work and projects do consider related ideas.

// Motivation
A research project that has greatly inspired this thesis is the showcase project of a Solid-based government-to-citizen use case as described by citenp:[both_german_2024].
In this project, the data of a citizen is maintained by several <<Data Trustee,Data Trustees>>, one for each governmental authority.
In this model, the citizen passes references to the maintained data to the individual authority, ensuring that the data is only stored once at the responsible authority.
This, however, resulted in the creation of a highly interconnected system, even with a relatively low number of authorities.
The issue that emerged was that, following the citizen's granting of access, the actual retrieval of data from the authority was not transparent to the citizen.
In order to regain control over the exposed data, the concept of a <<DPC>> was introduced.
With the problem of interconnected data in mind, as outlined in <<ISSUE-2>>.

// Projects
In addition to the research topics, there have been projects in the public sector addressing the issue of data exchange, access control, and transparency.
_X-Roadsfootnote:[https://x-road.global/]_ is an alternative ecosystem to Solid that offers unified and secure data exchange between organizations.
It is maintained by the _Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutionsfootnote:[https://www.niis.org/]_.
One of its central services is a monitoring system that logs data, as pointed out by citenp:[odonoghue_x-road_2023].
A project that is already utilizing Solid is _Athumifootnote:[https://athumi.be/]_, which acts as a trust partner for the purpose of strengthening data collaboration between consumers, businesses, and public agencies in _Flanders_.
citenp:[diederich_xdatenschutzcockpit_2023] describes the conclusion of a prototype period for a data privacy cockpit in Germany.
This cockpit was developed within an enclosed ecosystem to monitor a newly introduced digital registry, with the objective of achieving transparency for citizens and their data.

// Solid and Access Control
citenp:[esposito_assessing_2023] did consider security concerns, as outlined in the <<GDPR>> and other pertinent documents, in order to demonstrate their relevance to the measures in the <<Solid Protocol>>.
In this context, the lack of adequate logs has been criticized, as addressed in this work.
They have been separated into two kinds of logs: "Event logs for system behaviour and user activities" and "Tamper-proof access logs with different views".
As system behavior cannot be monitored from outside a system without modifying the <<Solid Provider>>, only access logs have been considered in the proposed approach.
One aspect that has been deliberately excluded is the recommendation not to provide logs in external storage resources.
This is due to the citenp:[esposito_assessing_2023] study, which has identified this as an unnecessary risk for the transmission of privacy-critical data over the internet.
This may be the case for transmissions over public networks, but in this approach, the proxy and the <<Solid Provider>> must be served in an enclosed network, as the proxy is the only server that might be publicly accessible.
citenp:[slabbinck_enforcing_2024] did propose a method for limiting access to a resource for a defined period of time, with the aim of gaining control over the exposed data utilizing an automated agent.
The automated agent mechanism was also employed in the work of citenp:[slabbinck_rule-based_2023], where the agent executes automated background processes to synchronize the state of a smart bulb with a Solid storage.
The concept of acting on behalf of another individual was also explored in the work of citenp:[schmid_rights_2024], where access privileges can be delegated to another agent via a proxyfootnote:[https://github.com/wintechis/delegation-proxy].

// Benchmark
One of the primary concerns of this thesis is to determine the impact of the proposed approach on <<Performance Efficiency>>.
In this context, it is reasonable to align the proposed approach with known benchmarks to determine the incremental impact it will have.
This will enable a clear understanding of the proposed approach's potential impact.
There are numerous benchmarks, such as the Proxy-Benchmarksfootnote:[https://github.com/NickMRamirez/Proxy-Benchmarks], which are designed to assess the efficiency of proxies.
In addition, citenp:[pan_survey_2018] presents a variety of <<RDF>> benchmark datasets, including the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM)footnote:[https://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/], the Berlin <<SPARQL>> Benchmark (BSBM), the DBpedia SPARQL Benchmark, and the SP^2Bench.
These benchmarks address specific scenarios, such as the passing through of a proxy or the querying of RDF data.
The obstacle in using the proxy is that the efficiency of the proxy is not of interest; only the module that is executed within the proxy is relevant.
Furthermore, querying <<RDF>> is not applicable to the context of this work, as it lives in a <<ROA>>, working with the actual resources.
The only benchmark that could be found suitable for Solid-based scenarios is SolidBench.jsfootnote:[https://github.com/SolidBench/SolidBench.js], which is limited to requests without <<Authentication>>.
As the objective of the <<DPC>> is to monitor authenticated requests, it is necessary to implement a bespoke mechanism, as outlined in the <<Network Parameters>> section of xref:Experiments[xrefstyle="short"].
