Since 2018, the Solid Community Groupfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/community/solid/] has been responsible for the management of the Solid Project.
Due to the relatively small size of the group and its limited public visibility, the level of activity within the community is correspondingly low.
Consequently, research sources are limited and related work is almost non-existent.
However, some work and projects do consider related ideas.

// Solid and Access Control
citenp:[esposito_assessing_2023] did consider security concerns, as outlined in the GDPR and other pertinent documents, in order to demonstrate their relevance to the measures in the Solid protocol.
Security concerns are currently addressed at various levels.
citenp:[slabbinck_enforcing_2024] did propose a method for limiting access to a resource for a defined period of time, with the aim of gaining control over the exposed data utilizing an automated agent.
The automated agent mechanism was also employed in the work of citenp:[slabbinck_rule-based_2023], where the agent executes automated background processes to synchronize the state of a smart bulb with a Solid storage.
The concept of acting on behalf of another individual was also explored in the work of citenp:[schmid_rights_2024], where access privileges can be delegated to another agent via a proxyfootnote:[https://github.com/wintechis/delegation-proxy].

// Projects
In addition to the research topics, there have been projects in the public sector addressing the issue of data exchange, access control, and transparency.
_X-Roadsfootnote:[https://x-road.global/]_ is an alternative ecosystem to Solid that offers unified and secure data exchange between organizations.
It is maintained by the _Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutionsfootnote:[https://www.niis.org/]_.
One of its central services is a monitoring system that logs data, as pointed out by citenp:[odonoghue_x-road_2023].
A project that is already utilizing Solid is _Athumifootnote:[https://athumi.be/]_, which acts as a trust partner for the purpose of strengthening data collaboration between consumers, businesses, and public agencies in _Flanders_.
citenp:[diederich_xdatenschutzcockpit_2023] describes the conclusion of a prototype period for a data privacy cockpit in Germany.
This cockpit was developed within an enclosed ecosystem to monitor a newly introduced digital registry, with the objective of achieving transparency for citizens and their data.
