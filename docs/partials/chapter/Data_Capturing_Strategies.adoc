= Data Capturing Strategies

In considering the optimal method for capturing accessed data, two primary options emerge.
One approach is to log the access of a resource permanently, in a manner analogous to system logs.
An alternative is for the agent to opt in to the monitoring of its storage.

Permanent:: A system of permanent access logs would continuously observe and record every route traversed within the network.
Opt-In:: The implementation of opt-in access logging would require the agent to register at some stage, thus enabling the system to monitor the relevant pathways.

Both options represent legitimate strategies to consider.
However, the permanent strategy is more restrictive and is suitable for administrative logging.
In contrast, the opt-in strategy is more suitable for a user scenario where the user actively chooses what should happen with their data (tbd.).
