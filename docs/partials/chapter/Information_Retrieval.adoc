= Information Retrieval

The <<DPC>> <<agent>> captures, manages, and presents client data.
Data can only be retrieved through the <<DPC>> <<agent>>.
xref:dm_Claim[xrefstyle=short] shows five paths through the data structure.
Two of the paths are alternative paths that lead to the same leaf of the graph.
The resulting data that can be received is:

[horizontal]
AccessLogShape:: following path [1,1,1], [1,2,1,1]
AccessLog:: following path [1,1,2], [1,2,2]
Verification:: following path [1,2,2]

The bracketed numbers indicate which branch to follow to access the described data.
