= Performance Efficiency

<<ISO>>/<<IEC>> 25010 is a quality model for the evaluation of system quality.
The quality model defines which characteristics are to be considered when a system is developed.
It considers various aspects of a software system.
In this case, the characteristics of performance efficiency are the central aspect that is observed.
It represents the extent to which a system performs its functions, considering the time and throughput necessary, its efficient use of resources, and the capacity used under specified conditions, as listed below:

[horizontal]
Time behavior:: A system's responsiveness and throughput are measures of its ability to perform the functions it is designed to perform.
Resource utilization:: The quantity and type of resources utilized by a system to fulfill its operational requirements.
Capacity:: The maximum limits of storage usage correspond to the system parameters.
