= System

Systems are defined in several ways, as citenp:[fischer_lexikon_2011] have observed.
In general, a system is a combination of interrelated elements that fulfill a common purpose.
In computer science, a system is an arrangement of interacting objects that is limited in scope.
According to the more concrete definition, a system is the sum of all hardware and software components of a data processing system from the point of view of their interaction.

In the context of a data-driven web-based system, the interaction of the system is further concretized.
The system must interact via data APIs over the network.
This is sometimes referred to as <<ROA>>, as defined by citenp:[richardson_restful_2007].
