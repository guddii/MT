= Research Design

The research will employ two different research methodologies, namely qualitative and quantitative, to address the research objectives and research interests.
Regarding the qualitative analysis, it is intended to explain how the proposed approach will affect the system design as required by <<QUEST-1>>.
On the other hand, a quantitative analysis will quantify the expected increase in the network load and the storage requirements in response to <<QUEST-2>> and <<QUEST-3>>.

The identified analyses will be conducted using data and insights collected from an experimental prototype.
The prototype must satisfy the specified requirements, which are derived from the problem definition.

The sampling will consider the schema values listed in xref:tbl-sampling-schema[xrefstyle=short].
In order to have comparable values, each sample will be taken with and without the considered approach.

It should be noted that the general proxy functions of delegating and forwarding requests have been excluded from this view.
There are various implementations of proxies that must not be considered in this research.
However, the DPC proxy module, which runs before and after the client response and request, has been included.
