= Ownership Verification

In decentralized systems, it appears that a resource cannot be directly associated with an owner.
This is also the case in Solid-based systems.
Despite the necessity for the system to know the ownership of the individual resource, it may not be exposed to the public.
One solution to this problem is to write a randomized verification token in the space associated with the owner.
This approach will be used within the prototype developed.
This ensures that the requester has a minimum level of privileges to the resource space.
It works in a manner analogous to other services, such as Googleâ€™s Search Consolefootnote:[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080].
A similar challenge is faced by these services, namely that the <<DNS>> server is only aware of the domain name and <<IP>> address relationship, but lacks the information necessary to determine the ownership of the domain name.
