= Conclusion

This thesis builds upon the prototypical implementation of the Data Privacy Cockpit (<<DPC>>) to explore the general possibility of extending <<Access Control and Traceability>>.
The DPC was designed for data-driven web-based systems with a vendor-agnostic approach over a web interface, with Solid as a technical foundation.
The ability to view actual requests to private resources on the web server represents a novel task within the <<Solid Ecosystem>>.
For the first time, it is possible to ascertain which agents have been granted access to specific resources.
However, these capabilities come with a drawback that has been extensively investigated.
On the one hand, the impact on the <<System Design>> design has been considered, and on the other hand, the loss of <<Performance Efficiency>> has been evaluated.

The analysis of the <<System Design Quality>> revealed that no critical violations of common design principles could be identified.
The majority of the violations identified relate to the orchestration of system components and are part of the <<Component Cohesion>> principles.
The only <<Component Coupling>> principle that was found to be violated is the <<ADP>>, which prohibits cyclic dependencies.
As previously noted in the <<ADP Analysis>>, this is, like the Component Cohesion principles, a violation that is not by design.
In this context, these principles have been discarded due to their maintenance benefits.

The findings of the <<Performance Efficiency Analysis>> are cause for concern.
The proposed approach resulted in a notable decline in <<Performance Efficiency>>, as evidenced by an increase in average response time and throughput.
However, the most significant drawback is the rise in error rate.
This, in turn, has the potential to either result in the complete failure of the system or to cause it to skip the logging process.
Even if executed correctly, the error rate, average response time, and throughput will increase significantly, effectively rendering the system inaccessible to users.
The quantity of parallel threads describing the interaction of a single user is the most evident aspect influencing this.

When planning the <<Objectives and Research Interest,Objectives and Research Interests>> of this thesis, it became evident that this examination could not encompass all aspects of the proposed approach.
However, it was intended to identify the vulnerable aspects of this concept in order to determine whether this approach should be pursued in principle.
When only considering the <<Analysis>> conducted, this approach appears to have no future.
However, as previously discussed in the <<Discussion>>, the erroneous behavior may not be solely attributed to this approach, as the other system components cannot be definitively excluded as a cause.
While there have been other concerns discussed, such as potential security risks related to the <<Authentication>> and claiming mechanism, this approach remains a promising one due to its flexibility and various implementation options.
For the time being, no general recommendation or objection can be made.
However, a caveat regarding the potential for high loads should be noted.
