= Data Capturing Strategies

In traditional approaches to data capturing, such as the logging or monitoring of access to resources on a web server, data is typically raised in a task that is executed in the background.
To illustrate, in the context of Node.jsfootnote:[https://nodejs.org/], this may be accomplished through the use of libraries such as morganfootnote:[https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan] or winstonfootnote:[https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston], which can be mounted as middlewares in a web server.
In the context of the proposed application, it is necessary to distinguish between requests based on their storage resource, for instance, through the use of a registry.
This presents an opportunity for an agent to opt in for monitoring.
This leads to two methods that are applicable in the context of how access logs can be captured.

[[Permanent]] Permanent:: A system of permanent access logs would continuously observe and record every route traversed within the network.
[[Opt-In]] Opt-In:: The implementation of opt-in access logging would require the agent to register at some stage, thus enabling the system to monitor the relevant pathways.

Both options represent viable strategies for consideration.
However, the permanent strategy is more restrictive and may not be optimal in this context.
In contrast, the opt-in strategy requires an agent to actively initiate access logging, which aligns with the concept of consent, a significant strength of the <<Solid Ecosystem>>.
