= Data Storage Structure

In general, data storage structures can be divided into two categories when sharing a set of data with other agents that have been granted access to the data in question.
The first category is _container-based_, which involves storing the shared data in a single storage resource and dividing it into container resources.
The second category is _storage-based_, which involves storing the shared data in multiple storage resources, all of which are owned by the same agent.

== Container-Based Storage

In a container-based arrangement, all data pertaining to multiple agents is stored in a single storage resource.
A mechanism must be in place or established to enable the agent with the requisite privileges to access the data.
With <<WAC>>, two main options exist for defining an _Access Object_.
In this context, the `acl:accessTo` option denotes the resource to which access is being granted, whereas the `acl:default` option denotes the container resource whose authorization can be applied to a resource lower in the collection hierarchy.
Consequently, the location and structure of the storage resource are publicly visible, thereby increasing the risk of information disclosure vulnerabilities.
The process of creating a new container resource however, is well part of the Solid Protocol and thereby the usage is unified.
The process of creating a new container resource, however, is a fundamental aspect of the Solid Protocol, thereby ensuring unified usage.
An illustrative example can be found in xref:lst-create-container[xrefstyle=short] cite:[capadisli_web_2022].

The implementation of custom mechanisms to expose data to associated agents may eliminate information disclosure vulnerabilities.
However, when bypassing the authorization mechanism provided by Solid, the risk of inadvertently exposing data to an agent that does not have the appropriate permissions increases.

== Storage-Based Storage

A storage-based approach to data storage for agents is a convenient method, as it encapsulates the data for an agent in a data space of their own.
This approach ensures that no unnecessary information is shown to the public and that the data is stored in a secure context.
As this is the purpose of a storage container, there is no individual mechanism required to ensure that the data is accidentally exposed to an agent that does not have any privileges to that data.
The `acl:accessTo` and `acl:default` mechanisms, which have been applicable in a <<Container-Based Storage>> context, can also be applied here.
However, there is a significant disadvantage to this approach over the <<Container-Based Storage>> approach.
Namely, there is no unified <<API>> in the specification.
While the creation of container resources is defined in the Solid Protocol, the creation of storage resources differs for each implementation. <<CSS>> for instance, requests a process in multiple steps, with the final step shown in xref:lst-create-storage-css[xrefstyle=short]footnote:[https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/7.x/usage/account/json-api/].

.Request for new storage resource in <<CSS>> for account `5e647928-b7f0-4357-9927-f54d66a04790`.

In contrast, Inruptâ€™s <<ESS>>, as an alternative Solid Provider, only requires a simple authorized POST request as shown in xref:lst-create-storage-ess[xrefstyle=short]footnote:[https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/2.2/services/service-pod-provision/#create-a-new-pod].
