	abstract = {The Solid speciﬁcation aims to empower data subjects by giving them direct access control over their data across multiple applications. As governments are manifesting their interest in this framework for citizen empowerment and e-government services, security and privacy represent pivotal issues to be addressed. By analysing the relevant legislation, with an emphasis on GDPR and ofﬁcially approved documents such as codes of conduct and relevant security ISO standards, we formulate the primary security and privacy requirements for such a framework. The legislation places some obligations on pod providers, much like cloud services. However, what is more interesting is that Solid has the potential to support GDPR compliance of Solid apps and data users that connect, via the protocol, to Solid pods containing personal data. A Solid-based healthcare use case is illustrated where identifying such controllers responsible for apps and data users is essential for the system to be deployed. Furthermore, we survey the current Solid protocol speciﬁcations regarding how they cover the highlighted requirements, and draw attention to potential gaps between the speciﬁcations and requirements. We also point out the contribution of recent academic work presenting novel approaches to increase the security and privacy degree provided by the Solid project. This paper has a twofold contribution to improve user awareness of how Solid can help protect their data and to present possible future research lines on Solid security and privacy enhancements.},

A new web security gateway solution based on HTTP reverse proxy server is proposed and the related system design and implements of key technologies are introduced. We provide a new concepts that called Security Detection \& Validate Chain (SDVC), based on SDVC and its hierarchical tree structure, and we can prevent network from attacking on the extensible way. This architecture can effectively resolve the difficult extending problem of the traditional web security protection problems. The web security gateway also can filter users by black \& white list, and can restrict the resource access which needs to be protected, as well as matching \& preventing many kinds of network attacking based on rules.},

	abstract = {We present a novel view of the structuring of distributed systems, and a few examples of its utilization in an object-oriented context. In a distributed system, the structure of a service or subsystem may be complex, being implemented as a set of communicating server objects; however, this complexity of structure should not be apparent to the client. In our proposal, a client must ﬁrst acquire a local object, called a proxy, in order to use such a service. The proxy represents the whole set of servers. The client directs all its communication to the proxy. The proxy, and all the objects it represents, collectively form one distributed object, which is not decomposable by the client. Any higher-level communication protocols are internal to this distributed object.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the computer techniques, researchers develop more and more application layer protocols to realize new functions. However, traditional reverse proxy servers can’t support these new protocols very well because of low extensibility. To solve the problem, we propose an extensible universal reverse proxy architecture which makes reverse proxy server more adaptive to new protocols by employing corresponding protocol plugins. When a client request comes, the universal reverse proxy server will analyze the data header by the protocol filter and then call the appropriate protocol plugin thread from the plugin pool, which will handle the client request and perform the reverse proxy work. Experimental results show that this architecture has the advantage of universality, extensibility and efficiency.},
