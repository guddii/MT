= Concept and Requirements

This section will address the general conceptual idea and subsequent refinements to the idea.
Based on the aforementioned idea, the requirements for the prototype will be established in order to achieve the desired outcomes.

== Concept

The concept is inspired by existing software solutions in the field of e-governance, such as _X-Road_ from Estonia and _XDatenschutzcockpit_, which is currently being developed in Germany for access control of citizen data.
Both systems have an embedded logging system that monitors access data.
Since they are tied to the specific context in which they are used, the idea of a *Data Privacy Cockpit* (<<DPC>>) will be ported to the Solid ecosystem.

When applying the concept to the Solid context, two fundamental software components can be identified to solve the problems under the given premises:

[horizontal]
DPC Middleware:: A server-side proxy module at the application level monitors data traffic and creates logs if necessary.
DPC Client:: The traffic data from the reverse proxy is displayed and managed by the client.

The concept idea's data capturing unit, the <<DPC>> Middleware, will be implemented as a proxy to meet the requirements of vendor-agnostic software that is secure from updates, as criticized in <<ISSUE-3>>, <<ISSUE-4>>, and <<ISSUE-5>>.
However, this requires the application to be a Solid application, as it communicates over <<HTTP>> <<API,APIs>> with the actual <<Solid Provider>>.
Since every request passes through the reverse proxy, there is a high risk of resulting in an inefficient software solution.

Upon reflection on the prototype, two central issues of the concept emerge instantly.
The first is the manner in which the data is captured by the <<DPC>> Middleware.
The second is the means by which the <<DPC>> Client is aware of the owner or potential accessor of the data captured.

== Requirements

The tension between vendor-agnostic software and efficiency is a key consideration for the solution's requirements, particularly in non-functional requirements.
However, the functional requirements are straightforward.

=== Functional Requirements

The following list outlines the minimum functions that the prototype must have in order to answer the questions.

[horizontal,labelwidth=15]
[[REQ-F1]] REQ-F1:: Present access logs with different views depending on the mandate.
[[REQ-F2]] REQ-F2:: Capture access logs with the specific content of the requested resource and the requesting party.
// [[REQ-F3,REQ-F3]] REQ-F3:: Rule-based filtering of network requests by the owner of the resource.

=== Non-Functional Requirements

In comparison to the functional requirements, establishing the following non-functional requirements is more challenging.
However, they are even more important as they verify the general conceptual idea.

[horizontal,labelwidth=15]
[[REQ-NF1]] REQ-NF1:: Metadata that could be extracted from the request should be analysed and logs should be enhanced accordingly.
[[REQ-NF2]] REQ-NF2:: Ensuring compatibility with the current version of the Solid protocol.
[[REQ-NF3]] REQ-NF3:: Efficiency in terms of response times must be appropriate.
// [[REQ-NF4]] REQ-NF4:: Conformity with the general properties of a proxy must be guaranteed.

The proposed solution is based on both functional and non-functional aspects.
The objective is to develop a prototype that meets the clientâ€™s requirement for traceability of accessed resources while operating accurately within a Solid ecosystem.

The conceptual idea is considered successful if the requirements could be satisfied adequately.
The adequacy will be evaluated with the prototype, as described in the <<Research Design>>.
