= Future Work

In the context of further work on this project, it is important to consider a number of additional factors that could potentially enhance the <<System Design>> and the <<Performance Efficiency>>.

As previously discussed, the most crucial objective is to identify a method for stabilizing and optimizing this approach.
Otherwise, any attempt to enhance this technique will inevitably lead to performance or load issues.
It would be beneficial to initiate future work with this issue in mind, beginning with a test of the Solid Provider and continuing with a proxy and all other participating system components.
This will enable an evaluation of the performance of each component, such as <<CSS>>, in relation to the approach in question.
Ultimately, a test of the specific configuration must be conducted in order to achieve optimal efficiency.
This may include the number of workersfootnote:[https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/7.x/usage/starting-server/] for multithreaded mode.
An alternative would be to consider a different server, such as the Manas solid serverfootnote:[https://manomayam.github.io/manas/], which focuses on robustness and concurrency.

It is assumed that the access logs are only accessible to the owner of a storage resource.
However, in a default configuration of <<CSS>>, this information is unknown when receiving an arbitrary resource from a storage resource.
This particular solid provider does provide a visibility optionfootnote:[https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/7.x/usage/account/json-api/] to assign a <<Identity>> to a storage resource.
If activated, the reference is contained as a link header in the response, as demonstrated in xref:lst-referenced-webid-in-response-header[xrefstyle=short].
This may potentially make the entire claiming mechanism obsolete, which would be an interesting topic for further investigation.

In this work, the issue of application-level caching has not been a concern.
The objective has been to ensure that all resources and relevant information are always the latest version, with no older version delivered from any caching mechanism.
However, in real-world scenarios, this approach would be considered a bad practice, as it would result in unnecessary network penetration.
The proposed approach does offer some instances in which caching may be suitable.
For instance, caching can be employed to discover the containing storage resource.
In this case, an arbitrary resource is reduced to the closest storage resource container.
This process occurs each time a resource is requested, even if there is minimal change frequency.
This is a scenario that should be investigated further to determine if caching is applicable.
There may be other scenarios that emerge as a result of further research on this topic.

Should the proposed <<System Design>> be retained, with a file located in the client's storage resource being read from the <<DPC>> agent, new possibilities emerge.
Clients may restrict or manipulate access from their individual storage resources without modifying the code.
Currently, this resource contains only the `claim:Verification` <<Thing>>.
However, it could also contain filtering rules for requests, which, for instance, limit access by specific patterns.
A research program in this direction could lead to a significant increase in control over data privacy, based on the transparency benefits achieved here.

A final suggestion for future work is to apply the proposed approach to other proxy modules.
The <<DPC Middleware>> is an illustrative example of how limits in the <<Solid Ecosystem>> or the individual Solid Provider could be overcome with the use of a intermediary design pattern, such as a proxy.
However, it is important to note that the <<DPC Middleware>> is only a single module with a specific purpose.
It would be of significant interest to ascertain the consequences of multiple proxy modules with distinct purposes.
The implications of a more extensive implementation of this concept, as exemplified by the <<DPC Middleware>>, may be of interest, as it represents a generic idea.
