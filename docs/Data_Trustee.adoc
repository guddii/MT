= Data Trustee

In the absence of an owner for the monitored resources, a concept is required to capture data and verify ownership at a later stage.
One such concept is that of data trustees, which collect data on behalf of a natural or legal person.
In the context of this work, the data trustee is an agent who captures data from the owner of the storage, who is another agent.
The data trustee is an independent entity of trust that acts as a mediator between the data provider and the data user, ensuring the secure and legally compliant transfer of data.
The concept can be distinguished by the type of data storage, which is either centralized or decentralized, and the type of data use, which is obligatory or optional cite:[specht-riemenschneider_designing_2022].
