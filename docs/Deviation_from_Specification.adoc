= Deviation from Specification

The divergence from the specifications, whether in the form of Solid Protocol or Solid Application Interoperability, is of vital importance in the analysis of the proposed <<DPC>> approach.
Any variation or unspecified use of an <<API>> may result in inconsistent or corrupt behaviour with other Solid Providers, which is detrimental to the generic approach that the proposed apprach is intended to be.
During the <<Design and Implementation>> of this approach, two main discrepancies in the specifications were identified.

The initial issue was identified as being related to the actual implementation of the utilized technologies.
It would be reasonable to consider this in the specification, as it is a generalized concern.
Both the proxy and server components engage in periodic self-requests for the purpose of writing access logs and verifying the identity.
Given the absence of a mechanism to prevent or limit recursive network calls, it has been necessary to implement a variety of custom mechanisms to exclude these requests from monitoring.
In the case of the <<Forwarded Request>>, this is presented as an `isLoggableRequest` condition.
The application logic behind this condition is comprised of three distinct tests.
One such test is that of a request header, which may or may not include a hash value.
This value is applied to requests originating from the same web instance.
Should the hash value in question align with the expected value, the request in question will not be monitored.
Another filter for self-requests is the test to determine if the request <<URL>> matches the <<OIDC>> configuration path.
This path is typically `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
In the case of <<CSS>>, this could be enhanced to include all internal data, as all internal <<URL>> paths begin with `/.`, but this technique is limited to <<CSS>> and is not a standard pattern.
Finally, all agent WebIDs, which are utilized in middleware, are to be disregarded.
As the connection is established within the middleware, the agents to be filtered are known at the time they are to be excluded.
The filters for the <<OIDC>> configuration path, as well as the WebID of the middleware agent, are obtained from the server instance.
In the absence of control over the fetcher, as is the case here, the request header hash mechanism cannot be employed.

Another issue that was identified was the necessity of writing data to container resources.
With a fundamental understanding of the <<CRUD>> operations, it would be relatively straightforward to perform a `POST`/`PUT` or `PATCH` request to the resource in question, for example: `PUT http://proxy.localhost:4000/client/data/`.
However, this is not the case with <<CSS>>, as writing to container resources involves writing metadata.
Metadata refers to the <<#description_resource,Description Resources>> mechanism, where a resource is linked as illustrated in xref:lst-storage-resource[xrefstyle=short].
With the used version of <<CSS>>, only `PATCH` methods are permitted, resulting in a request such as `PATCH http://proxy.localhost:4000/client/data/.meta` for the creation of data and `GET http://proxy.localhost:4000/client/data/` if the data is read.
This behavior is exclusive to <<CSS>>, yet a fundamental <<API>> to employ when <<Solid Application Interoperability>> is implemented, as the ShapeTrees are read from the resources containers, thereby inheriting the shape to the child resources.
