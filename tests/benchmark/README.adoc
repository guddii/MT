= Benchmark

This package is designed for the purpose of benchmarking the implementation of the data privacy cockpit.
The software employs https://jmeter.apache.org[Apache JMeter] for load testing, executed from a node.js instance.

== Installation

This tool requires `jmeter`, which is available on the command line.
Please refer to the installation instructions from Apache JMeter for guidance: https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#install.
Alternatively, you can install it with your preferred package manager (e.g., `brew install jmeter`).

This package will be built with the other packages when executing the build command at the umbrella package.
Should you wish to build only this package, please run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
turbo run build --filter=@seact/benchmark
----

== Usage

Please use a probabilistic sequence of CRUD requests, which will be executed on the data privacy cockpit middleware instance.
Alternatively, you may generate your own sequence:

[source]
----
node ./tests/benchmark/dist/index.js generate sequence | tee ./tests/benchmark/data/models/TP1.json
----

The sequence can be processed for viewing in Asciidoc documents...

[source]
----
cat ./tests/benchmark/data/models/TP2.json | node ./tests/benchmark/dist/index.js generate adoc
----

...or used for the generation of JMeter test plans.

[source]
----
cat ./tests/benchmark/data/models/TP1.json | node ./tests/benchmark/dist/index.js generate testplan | tee ./tests/benchmark/data/plans/TP1.jmx
----

This test plan can now be run using the following command:

[source]
----
pnpm run benchmark
----
