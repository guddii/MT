= HTTP Client Testing

The files contained in this folder can be used for fast HTTP testing.
The format used here is the one specified by the Jetbrains HTTP Client.
For further information please consult the documentation https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product code editor.html

== Installation

Before the `.http` files can be executed, client credentials must be created for the test user and storage.
While the application is running, open a browser window at http://localhost:4000/.account/login/password.
Login with the default user (`client@example.com`) and password (`secret!`) and create the credentials in the corresponding section.
Add it to a file called http-client.private.env.json, as shown below.

[source,json]
----
{
  "dev": {
    "clientId": "client_1cd58f98-1507-4d12-acab-539b418b3fb0",
    "clientSecret": "73b0b5a4bcda016a97cbb40f8b244c3e3c2e01badb16d72d078d5d8382d694eb28e8a708da8cde6bd9db0da6e6f18ff6ab9adf5601a23ec8a5c7ad574abf32d1",
    "dpcId": "dpc_93a5b9ea-e848-44cd-aea3-8ed8c6490703",
    "dpcSecret": "a505ecdcaefbd7b344fc9dee6816b07d0aa99fe6908c3e91313b67a54389455e30ad2e4436c5e9d5dd5799a1b61319ce9e47e9439f3153a72bd840e713a465e3"
  }
}

The `clientId` and `clientSecret` values are just examples, and you need to change them like explained before.

== Usage with IntelliJ

The HTTP requests can be executed as explained in https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html#run_request.
The environment that needs to be chosen is `dev`.

== Usage with Docker

At this time, the Docker image of the HTTP client can only run unauthorized requests, as the http-client.env.json cannot be serialized properly.
Those requests can be filtered by a wildcard `*.public.http`, which leads to the following command:


[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/workdir jetbrains/intellij-http-client:latest \
  --log-level=BASIC \
  --private-env-file=http-client.private.env.json \
  --env=dev \
  --docker-mode \
  src/*.public.http
